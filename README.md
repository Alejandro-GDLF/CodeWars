# Matrix Determinant
Write a function that accepts a square matrix (N x N 2D array) and returns the determinant of the matrix.

How to take the determinant of a matrix -- it is simplest to start with the smallest cases:

A 1x1 matrix |a| has determinant a.

A 2x2 matrix [ [a, b], [c, d] ] or

>|a  b|<br>
>|c  d|

has determinant: a*d - b*c.
